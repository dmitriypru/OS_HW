We should use:

- Recovery through Preemption if it's possible to temporarily take a resource away from its current owner and give it to another process.
- Recovery through Rollback if we can use "checkpoints" to restart processes at the specified points when it's needed.
- Recovery through Killing Processes if it's possible to carefully kill processes that is holding needed resources.
- Avoidance strategy if the system is be able to decide whether granting a resource is safe or not.
- Prevention strategy if we can't do anything of listed above.
